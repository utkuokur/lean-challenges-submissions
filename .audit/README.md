# Audit archive recipient list

This directory holds the recipient list for the long-term audit archive
maintained in the **private** `lean-challenges-audit` repository.

[`recipients.txt`](recipients.txt) is read by `age` in the submission
workflow to encrypt every submission's source tarball before it is
uploaded to the audit repo. Each non-comment line is one recipient: a
native age key (`age1...`) or an SSH public key.

Anyone with the matching private key of any recipient line can decrypt
every archived submission, past or future. Adding a recipient is
therefore equivalent to granting permanent read access to the full
archive. Treat additions as PRs requiring maintainer review.

A push-time CI workflow
([`.github/workflows/validate-recipients.yml`](../.github/workflows/validate-recipients.yml))
parses every line on every change so syntactically broken recipients
cannot reach `main`.

See [`docs/audit-archive.md`](../docs/audit-archive.md) for the full
design and the decryption procedure.
